# Capability-Based Entitlement System

A scalable way to manage plan-based features in a multi-tenant Flutter application.

---

## Context

The app is used by guardians and schools (pesantren) that can subscribe to different plans:
**Basic**, **Gold**, and **Platinum**.  
Each pesantren can have its own plan, and the user can switch between multiple pesantren inside the
app. Certain features (like advanced reports or financial dashboards) should only be available on
higher‑tier plans.

---

## Problem

The naive implementation would be to sprinkle checks like `if (plan == "gold")` across controllers
and widgets. This quickly becomes:

- Hard to maintain as the app grows.
- Easy to get wrong (especially with deep links and direct route calls).
- Difficult to change when business wants to move features between plans, run promotions, or
  introduce new variants.

We needed a way to ask **“Can this user do X right now?”** that works consistently across:

- Routing and deep links.
- Controllers and UI.
- Domain logic and use cases.

---

## Goals

- Have a **single source of truth** for “which features are available on which plan”.
- Let feature code depend on **capabilities** (“manage PIN”, “view advanced reports”), not plan
  names (“Gold”, “Platinum”).
- Make plan changes safe and easy: update one mapping instead of editing many screens.
- Enforce entitlements in layers (UI visibility, route guards, domain checks) so the experience is
  both user‑friendly and robust against navigation tricks.

## 1️⃣ System Architecture Overview

**Overview:** This diagram shows how plan information flows from the backend through the entitlement
service to controllers and UI components. The system uses capability-based access control to
decouple feature availability from specific plan names.

## 2️⃣ Runtime Flow: Capability Check

**Scenario:** The user navigates to the Account Security screen. The system checks whether the user
has the `security.manage_pin` capability and updates the UI accordingly. The UI automatically reacts
when the user switches pesantren or when plan changes occur.

<Mermaid
  code={`
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant US as Current User Service
    participant ES as Entitlement Service
    participant C as Account Security Controller
    participant UI as Account Security Screen

    Note over US: Startup / pesantren change
    US-->>ES: User snapshot (appPackage, selection)
    ES->>ES: Map plan variant to capabilities set
    ES-->>ES: Update current plan + caps
    ES-->>C: Emit entitlements stream

    Note over U,UI: User opens security screen
    U->>UI: Navigate to Account Security
    UI->>C: onInit()

    C->>ES: hasCapability(security.manage_pin)?
    ES-->>C: true / false
    C-->>UI: expose canManagePin flag

    alt canManagePin == true
        UI-->>U: Show "Create PIN" action
    else
        UI-->>U: Hide or lock PIN actions
    end

    Note over US,ES: Later: user switches pesantren / plan changes
    US-->>ES: New user snapshot (new appPackage)
    ES->>ES: Recompute plan + capabilities
    ES-->>C: New entitlements
    C-->>UI: Update canManagePin
    UI-->>U: UI reacts (button appears / disappears)
`}
/>

### How this flow works

#### 1. Backend → current user → entitlements

- The backend associates each pesantren with a plan (e.g. via a plan code or package string).
- The app fetches the current user snapshot, which contains:
  - User information.
  - The currently selected pesantren.
  - That pesantren's plan indicator (e.g. `basic`, `gold`, `platinum`).
- Whenever the snapshot changes (login, logout, switch pesantren), the entitlement service:
  - Reads the plan indicator.
  - Maps it to a plan variant.
  - Looks up the corresponding capability set from a central mapping.
  - Stores this as the **current plan + capabilities** and emits an update.

#### 2. Controllers & UI using capabilities (not plans)

- Feature controllers never ask “is this Gold or Platinum?” directly.
- Instead they ask the entitlement service: **“Do we have capability X?”**
  - Example: the account security controller asks for `security.manage_pin` to decide whether to
    show the “Create PIN” action.
- On initialization:
  - Controllers call `hasCapability(...)` once to seed booleans like `canManagePin`,
    `canSeeFinancialOverview`, `canUseMarketplace`.
  - When features must react to plan changes at runtime (e.g. user switches pesantren),
    controllers subscribe to the entitlements stream and update those booleans whenever a new
    plan / capability set arrives.
- Widgets then bind to those booleans and:
  - Show or hide actions.
  - Show a “locked” state with an upsell message.
  - Or route the user to an upgrade flow.

## 3️⃣ Route Protection Flow

**Scenario:** The user attempts to navigate to a premium feature (for example via menu, deep link,
or direct navigation). A route guard checks capabilities before allowing access, preventing
unauthorized navigation even via direct URLs.

<Mermaid
  code={`
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant UI as Menu / Navigation
    participant MW as Capability Guard
    participant ES as Entitlement Service

    U->>UI: Tap "Advanced Reports"
    UI->>MW: Attempt to navigate to premium route

    MW->>ES: hasCapability(guardian.advanced_reports)?
    ES-->>MW: true / false

    alt capability present
        MW-->>UI: allow navigation
        UI-->>U: Show premium screen
    else
        MW-->>UI: block or redirect (e.g. back to Home / upsell)
        UI-->>U: Show message or upgrade prompt
    end
`}
/>

### Routing and deep-link protection

- Some screens are premium and should never be accessible without the right plan, even if:
  - A developer calls the route directly by mistake.
  - A deep link or push notification points to the premium route.
- For these routes, the navigation layer can attach a **capability guard**:
  - Before navigation completes, the guard calls `hasCapability(...)`.
  - If the capability is present, navigation proceeds.
  - If not, navigation is blocked or redirected (e.g. back to home, or to an upgrade screen).
- This acts as a safety net on top of the UI gating:
  - UI **tries** not to show buttons and links the user shouldn’t see.
  - Route guards **ensure** the user cannot reach protected screens without entitlements.

---

## What this system does

- Models three commercial plan variants (**Basic**, **Gold**, **Platinum**) and maps each plan to a
  set of **capabilities** (features the user is allowed to use, like “manage PIN”, “guardian
  financial overview”, “advanced reports”, “marketplace”).
- Provides a single **entitlement service** that answers:
  - “What plan is active for the currently selected pesantren?”
  - “Does the current user have capability X right now?”
  - “Notify me when plan / capabilities change.”
- Uses those answers in:
  - Controllers & UI to show / hide or lock specific actions and menu items.
  - Route guards to prevent navigation to premium screens without the right capabilities, even via
    deep links.

---

## Core concepts in the flow

### Plan variant

A simple label like `basic`, `gold`, or `platinum` derived from the backend‑provided `appPackage` on
the current user snapshot. Conceptually this reflects the active pesantren’s subscription plan.

### Capability

A stable, namespaced “ability” such as:

- `security.manage_pin`
- `guardian.financial_overview`
- `guardian.advanced_reports`
- `marketplace.core`

### Plan → capabilities mapping

A central map that describes which capabilities each plan includes, for example:

- **Basic** → `{donation.basic}`
- **Gold** → `{donation.basic, guardian.financial_overview, marketplace.core, security.manage_pin}`
- **Platinum** → everything in Gold + `guardian.advanced_reports`

This mapping is the **only** place that encodes which plan gets which features. Feature code never
hard‑codes “Gold” or “Platinum”; it only asks for capabilities.

### Entitlement service

- Listens to changes in the current user snapshot (including selected pesantren and its plan).
- Converts backend / plan data into:
  - The effective plan variant.
  - The full set of capabilities for that plan.
- Exposes:
  - A quick `hasCapability(...)` check.
  - A stream of updates so the UI can react to plan / pesantren changes.

---

## Why this design is useful

- **Capabilities over plans:** Feature code doesn’t care about “Gold vs Platinum”, it cares about
  specific abilities like “manage PIN” or “view advanced reports”. If business changes which plan
  includes which feature, you update one mapping instead of touching many screens.
- **Single source of truth:** The entitlement service is the only place that knows the current plan
  and capabilities. Everything else (controllers, widgets, route guards) goes through it.
- **Multi‑tenant aware:** Since the plan is tied to the selected pesantren, when the user switches
  school, the entitlement service recomputes entitlements and the UI can respond automatically.
- **Layered enforcement:**
  - Menus and screens use capabilities to control visibility and upsell.
  - Navigation guards use capabilities to prevent unauthorized access.
  - The backend is still expected to enforce plan rules server‑side, but the client gives
    immediate, clear feedback to the user.

## Data flow summary

1. **Backend → User Service → Entitlement Service:**  
   Plan data flows from backend through the user snapshot to the entitlement service, which maps it
   to capabilities.
2. **Entitlement Service → Controllers:**  
   Controllers query capabilities (not plans) to make feature decisions.
3. **Controllers → UI:**  
   UI binds to capability-based flags and shows / hides features accordingly.
4. **Entitlement Service → Route Guards:**  
   Navigation is protected by capability checks at the routing layer.
5. **Reactive updates:**  
   When the plan changes (pesantren switch, upgrade / downgrade), the stream propagates updates
   throughout the app.
